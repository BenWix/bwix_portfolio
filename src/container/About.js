                <p>I am a mechanical engineer turned web developer. 
                    My interest in coding was sparked during my undergraduate years at Purdue University. 
                    After graduating, I followed my passion for environmental causes and 
                    sustainable living by building tiny houses with a green builder (
                    find me on an episode of HGTV's <em>Tiny House, Big Living</em>). This experience 
                    increased my enthusiasm for real estate projects.
                </p> 
                
                <p>When my work building tiny houses came to a close, I gained additional professional experience working as a fire sprinkler design engineer 
                    and as a mechanical design engineer at a machine shop making machines for manufacturing. 
                    I wanted to return to coding because of the fun challenges coding presented, tech industry's culture
                    , and the desire for a greener career.
                </p>
                <p>When I am not working on a project, I am outside having fun. I have been a rock 
                    climber for my entire adult life and I am an avid birder. I love to run, mountain bike
                    , and I perform and teach partner acrobatics with my partner, Meghan.
